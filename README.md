My first repository for IDEA9103

This is my first local change to the repo!

# Part 1

The inspiration for the first part comes from the different overlapping of different circles, creating shadows of overlapping parts. By putting this element into our work, several circles can be superimposed together to produce a new color block, creating a sense of intersecting circles and color blocks visually, so as to achieve the effect that a circle is produced by two or more color combinations.The second inspiration in this artwork comes from the falling feeling of the sphere. In our project, we can place the circle on a set track to slide back and forth.

## Part 2

Although this code is done by drawing waves, I can borrow the technique to form the bar with circles. First, The ellipse() function is used in this code to draw waves, but in our project we can use the ellipse() function to draw circles. Second, a series of circles are dynamically generated in the setup() function to form a bar. Different effects can be achieved by controlling the position, size, and color of the circle. Second, use for loop to draw, for loop can be used to draw a series of circles repeatedly, thus forming the entire bar. We can adjust the number of loops and parameters. Finally, we can try different arrangements, such as vertical and horizontal directions.
